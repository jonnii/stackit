# Metadata Storage

This document describes the metadata system used by Stackit to track branch relationships, PR information, and stack-level data. All metadata is stored in Git refs, enabling atomic updates and sync across machines.

## Overview

Stackit uses **Git refs** as the storage mechanism for all metadata. Metadata is stored as JSON blobs, with refs pointing to blob SHAs. This approach provides:

- **Atomic updates**: Multi-ref changes via `git update-ref --stdin`
- **Version control**: Metadata history via reflog
- **Sync capability**: Push/fetch metadata alongside code
- **No external dependencies**: Everything lives in the Git repository

## Ref Namespaces

Stackit uses five ref namespaces:

| Namespace | Purpose | Synced to Remote |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| `refs/stackit/metadata/{branch}` | Per-branch metadata (parent, PR info, scope, etc.) | Yes |
| `refs/stackit/local-metadata/{branch}` | Local-only branch state (frozen, cached IDs) | No |
| `refs/stackit/stacks/{stack-id}` | Stack-level metadata (title, description) | Yes |
| `refs/stackit/remote-stacks/{stack-id}` | Fetched remote stack metadata (read-only) | N/A (fetched) |
| `refs/stackit/undo/{snapshot-id}` | Working-tree captures anchored to an undo snapshot | No |

## Undo Snapshot Captures

**Refs**: `refs/stackit/undo/{snapshot-id}` and `refs/stackit/undo/{snapshot-id}-untracked`

**Source**: `internal/engine/undo.go`

A snapshot records branch and metadata SHAs (`.git/stackit/undo/*.json`), which
is enough to roll refs back but not enough to put the user back where they
started. Commands like `modify` and `create` turn the working tree into a
commit, so rolling that commit away without the working tree deletes work the
user never committed themselves.

Snapshots taken by those commands therefore also capture the uncommitted state:

- a stash commit (`git stash create`) holding tracked modifications and the
  index, which preserves the staged/unstaged split on restore
- a separate commit holding untracked, non-ignored files, which stashes exclude
  but `git add -A` would have committed

Capturing is opt-in per command (`SnapshotOptions.CaptureWorktree`, or
`actions.WithWorktreeCapture()`), and only `modify`, `create`, `absorb`, and
`split` set it — they are the commands that turn the working tree into a commit.
Everything else pays nothing: `restack` and `sync` hold back a worktree with
uncommitted changes instead of rebasing it, so they can neither consume such
work nor destroy it on rollback, and a capture there would be ~35ms of wasted
`git stash create` per invocation on a 30k-file repository.

Both are unreachable commits, so each is anchored under `refs/stackit/undo/` —
otherwise `git gc` is free to collect the user's work — and both are deleted
when the snapshot that owns them is pruned by `undo.depth`.

Snapshots live under `<git-dir>/stackit/undo`, resolved with `git.GetGitDir`
rather than by joining `.git` onto the repo root. A linked worktree's `.git` is
a file, so the naive path lands under a file and every snapshot write fails —
silently, since snapshots are best-effort — in exactly the checkout the worktree
workflow tells you to run `modify` from. Resolving the git directory also gives
each worktree its own undo stack, which is what you want: a capture holds the
uncommitted state of the tree it was taken from, and applying it to a different
worktree would be wrong.

`abort` and `undo` restore refs first, then re-apply the capture onto the
rolled-back tree: the tracked stash, then the untracked files. Restoring an
untracked file never overwrites a file that currently exists on disk. The stash
apply is an ordinary `git stash apply`, so it does merge into whatever the
working tree holds — which is why `undo` refuses to run against a dirty tree it
did not capture.

### Which snapshot abort rolls back to

`abort` restores the snapshot named by `SnapshotID` in the continuation state
(`.git/.stackit_continue`), written by `EnterConflictWorkflow` from
`Engine.LastSnapshotID()` — the snapshot the halted command itself recorded.

It restores that snapshot or nothing. When the field is empty, or the snapshot
has aged out of the undo stack, `abort` unwinds the Git state, says it has no
rollback point, and points at `stackit undo` for a manual choice. Reaching for
the newest snapshot on disk instead is what let a conflicted `reorder` or
`delete` roll the repository back past an unrelated `create` and delete the
branch that `create` had made.

Any command that can enter the conflict workflow therefore needs a snapshot of
its own, taken before its first mutation. Commands take one as late as that rule
allows: `submit` only when a branch actually needs restacking, `reorder` only
once the order has changed, and `restack` only when `plan.HasWork()`.

`sync` is the exception that shows where the line is. Its conflict comes from
the restack phase at the very end, but by then it has already updated trunk,
deleted merged branches, and reparented their children. Snapshotting at the
restack phase would be cheaper and would still bind `abort` to the right
command — but `abort` would report that it restored the state before `sync`
while leaving every one of those deletions in place. So `sync` snapshots before
`syncFetchedTrunk`, its first visible ref move, and a sync that turns out to
have nothing to do pays for one anyway.

## Branch Metadata (`Meta`)

**Ref**: `refs/stackit/metadata/{branch-name}`

**Source**: `internal/git/metadata.go` (`Meta`)

Branch metadata stores the relationship between branches and associated PR information.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `parentBranchName` | `*string` | Name of the parent branch |
| `parentBranchRevision` | `*string` | Git SHA of parent at time of divergence (for detecting when restack is needed) |
| `prInfo` | `*PrInfoPersistence` | PR information (number, title, body, state, etc.) |
| `scope` | `*string` | Branch scope for inherited PR prefix (e.g., `"PROJ-123"`) |
| `lockReason` | `LockReason` | Why the branch is locked: `""`, `"user"`, or `"consolidating"` |
| `branchType` | `BranchType` | Type: `"user"`, `"utility"`, or `"worktree-anchor"` |
| `lastModifiedBy` | `*ModifiedBy` | Who last changed this metadata |
| `lastModifiedAt` | `*time.Time` | When metadata was last changed |
| `localOnlyHash` | `*string` | Hash of local-only state for change detection (never pushed) |

| `stackId` | `*string` | Links branch to stack ref |

### Example

```json
{
  "parentBranchName": "main",
  "parentBranchRevision": "abc123def456",
  "prInfo": {
    "number": 42,
    "base": "main",
    "url": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42",
    "title": "[PROJ-123] Add feature X",
    "body": "## Summary\n\nAdds feature X...",
    "state": "OPEN",
    "isDraft": false
  },
  "scope": "PROJ-123",
  "lockReason": "",
  "branchType": "user",
  "stackId": "1706789123456789-feature-x"
}
```

### Lifecycle

| Operation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `stackit create` | Creates metadata with parent name/revision, inherits stack ID from parent |
| `stackit submit` | Updates `prInfo` with PR number, URL, title, body, state |
| `stackit restack` | Updates `parentBranchRevision` to current parent SHA |
| `stackit lock` | Sets `lockReason` to `"user"` |
| `stackit unlock` | Clears `lockReason` |
| `stackit scope set` | Sets `scope` field |
| Merged parent | Adds entry to `mergedDownstack`, updates `parentBranchName` |
| `stackit delete` | Deletes the metadata ref |

---

## Local Metadata (`LocalMeta`)

**Ref**: `refs/stackit/local-metadata/{branch-name}`

**Source**: `internal/git/metadata.go` (`LocalMeta`)

Local metadata is never pushed to remote. It stores per-machine state.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `frozen` | `bool` | Branch is frozen locally (excluded from restack/submit) |
| `needsPRBodyUpdate` | `bool` | Flag indicating PR body needs update during sync |
| `navigationCommentId` | `*int64` | Cached GitHub comment ID for navigation commands |

### Example

```json
{
  "frozen": true,
  "needsPRBodyUpdate": false,
  "navigationCommentId": 12345678
}
```

### Lifecycle

| Operation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `stackit freeze` | Sets `frozen` to `true` |
| `stackit unfreeze` | Sets `frozen` to `false` |
| `stackit sync` | May set `needsPRBodyUpdate` for deferred updates |
| Navigation comment posted | Caches `navigationCommentId` |
| `stackit delete` | Deletes the local metadata ref |

---

## Stack Metadata (`StackMeta`)

**Ref**: `refs/stackit/stacks/{stack-id}`

**Source**: `internal/git/stack_metadata.go` (`StackMeta`)

Stack metadata stores information about an entire stack. It survives branch operations like merging the root branch, because it's stored separately from branch metadata.

### Stack ID Format

```
{timestamp-nanos}-{sanitized-root-branch}
```

**Example**: `1706789123456789-feature-x`

The sanitized branch name:
- Contains only alphanumeric characters and hyphens
- Maximum 50 characters
- No leading/trailing hyphens
- Falls back to `"stack"` if all characters are invalid

### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Stack ID (matches ref name) |
| `title` | `string` | Stack title (displayed in UI) |
| `description` | `string` | Stack description (longer narrative) |
| `createdAt` | `time.Time` | When the stack was created |
| `createdBy` | `string` | Who created the stack (git user name) |

### Example

```json
{
  "id": "1706789123456789-feature-x",
  "title": "Add user authentication",
  "description": "This stack implements OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub providers.\n\nPhase 1: Core auth flow\nPhase 2: Provider integrations\nPhase 3: Session management",
  "createdAt": "2024-02-01T10:30:00Z",
  "createdBy": "Jane Developer"
}
```

### Lifecycle

| Operation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `stackit create` (first branch off trunk) | Generates new stack ID, creates stack ref |
| `stackit create` (off tracked branch) | Inherits parent's stack ID |
| `stackit describe` | Sets/updates `title` and `description` |
| Reparenting to different stack | Updates branch's `stackId` to match new parent |
| All branches deleted | Stack ref remains (for history) |

---

## Supporting Types

### LockReason

**Source**: `internal/git/metadata.go` (`LockReason`)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `""` (empty) | Not locked |
| `"user"` | Manually locked by user via `stackit lock` |
| `"consolidating"` | Locked during merge consolidation operation |

### BranchType

**Source**: `internal/git/metadata.go` (`BranchType`)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"user"` | Normal stacked branch created by user |
| `"utility"` | Created by `stackit merge --consolidate` or internal operations |
| `"worktree-anchor"` | Anchor branch for worktree (has no commits of its own) |

### PrInfoPersistence

**Source**: `internal/git/metadata.go` (`PrInfoPersistence`)

PR information persisted in branch metadata.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `number` | `*int` | PR number |
| `base` | `*string` | Base branch name |
| `url` | `*string` | PR URL |
| `title` | `*string` | PR title |
| `body` | `*string` | PR description/body |
| `state` | `*string` | PR state: `"OPEN"`, `"MERGED"`, `"CLOSED"` |
| `isDraft` | `*bool` | Whether PR is a draft |
| `lockReason` | `*LockReason` | Lock status parsed from PR footer |
| `mergeBranch` | `*string` | Merge branch name for consolidated PRs |

### Merge Method Compatibility

PR metadata is part of Stackit's safety model. A PR state of `"MERGED"` means
the branch's changes landed, but it does not imply the branch tip is reachable
from trunk:

- GitHub merge commits preserve ancestry, so the PR branch tip is reachable from
  the base branch.
- GitHub squash merges create one new commit for the combined PR diff; the
  original PR commits are not reachable from the base branch.
- GitHub rebase merges replay commits with new SHAs; the original PR commits are
  not reachable from the base branch.

Code that consumes `prInfo.state`, updates merged metadata, cleans branches, or
restacks descendants must treat all three GitHub merge methods as valid. Do not
use ancestry alone to decide whether a PR's changes landed, and do not treat a
non-ancestor branch tip as proof that a merged PR still needs to be replayed.

### MergedParent

**Source**: `internal/git/metadata.go` (`MergedParent`)

Records historical parent relationships when branches are reparented.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `branchName` | `string` | Name of the former parent branch |
| `prNumber` | `*int` | PR number of the merged/closed parent |
| `prState` | `*string` | State when reparented: `"MERGED"`, `"CLOSED"` |

Limited to 5 entries (oldest entries dropped when limit exceeded).

### ModifiedBy

**Source**: `internal/git/metadata.go` (`ModifiedBy`)

Tracks who last modified metadata.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `gitName` | `string` | Git user name |
| `gitEmail` | `string` | Git user email |
| `githubUsername` | `*string` | GitHub username (if known) |

---

## Scope Inheritance

**Source**: `internal/engine/types.go`

Scopes are inherited from parent branches. When a branch doesn't have an explicit scope, Stackit walks up the parent chain until it finds one.

| Scope Value | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| `""` (empty) | No explicit scope, inherit from parent |
| `"none"` or `"clear"` | Breaks inheritance, children don't inherit |
| Any other string | Scope prefix (e.g., `"PROJ-123"`) |

Scopes are applied to PR titles: `[PROJ-123] Feature description`

---

## Transactions

**Source**: `internal/engine/transaction.go`

Metadata updates use transactions for atomicity. A `MetadataTx`:

1. Batches multiple ref updates
2. Uses compare-and-swap (CAS) validation to detect concurrent modifications
3. Commits all changes atomically via `git update-ref --stdin`
4. Updates in-memory cache on success

```go
tx := e.BeginTx("set parent: feature -> main")
tx.UpdateMeta(branchName, meta)
tx.UpdateLocalMeta(branchName, localMeta)
err := tx.Commit(ctx)  // All or nothing
```

Concurrent modification errors trigger automatic retry with exponential backoff.

### Compare-and-swap on individual writes

CAS is not limited to `MetadataTx`. `WriteMetadata` and `WriteLocalMetadata`
also write conditionally, because two Stackit processes in different worktrees
that each read a branch and then wrote it used to keep only the second write —
silently dropping whatever the first recorded (a parent change, a PR number, a
scope).

Metadata refs point straight at a blob, and `cat-file` already reports that
blob's SHA in its header. Stackit keeps it and requires the ref to still hold
that blob when writing back. A write based on state another process has already
replaced fails and says so.

Details that matter when working on this code:

- **The expectation is what *this process* last read**, not what the ref holds
  now. A write of unchanged content is therefore not short-circuited as a no-op:
  doing so would report success for a ref another process may have moved.
- **An unknown expectation falls back to an unconditional write.** This is what
  creating metadata for a newly tracked branch needs.
- **Both read paths record the SHA.** `ReadMetadata` and `BatchReadMetadata`
  (via `ReadObjectsBatch`) populate it. This is load-bearing: engine graph loads
  go through the batch path, so recording it only on `ReadMetadata` left the
  expectation empty for essentially every command and silently degraded every
  write to unconditional.
- **A rejected write drops the cache entry.** The expectation is known-stale at
  that point; keeping it meant a re-read answered from cache, recomputed the same
  expectation, and failed identically forever — harmless in the short-lived CLI,
  a wedge in the long-lived server.

Branch refs rewritten by a rebase are also moved compare-and-swap
(`internal/git/rebase.go`), so a concurrent update in another worktree is
detected rather than overwritten.

## Viewing Metadata

To inspect raw metadata:

```bash
# List all metadata refs
git for-each-ref refs/stackit/

# Read branch metadata
git show refs/stackit/metadata/feature-branch

# Read stack metadata
git show refs/stackit/stacks/1706789123456789-feature-x

# Read local metadata
git show refs/stackit/local-metadata/feature-branch
```

## Storage Details

- **JSON format**: All metadata is stored as pretty-printed JSON
- **Blob storage**: JSON is stored in Git blobs (`git hash-object -w`)
- **Ref pointing**: Refs point to blob SHAs (not commits)
- **Atomic updates**: `git update-ref --stdin` for batch operations
- **Reflog**: Updates are recorded in reflog with descriptive messages
